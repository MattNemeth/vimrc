Repo is used to store my vimrc setting file and document other useful vim tricks


# Vim Tips and Tricks I pick up:

2. insert mode
3. Right click, paste it
4. exit insert
5. :set no paste

For Ubuntu and likely for other Distros - /usr/share/vim has a vimrc file that looks for a local vimrc.local file in /etc/vim/
